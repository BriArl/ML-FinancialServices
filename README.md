# ML-FinancialServices
This repository contains a Python project demonstrating the application of machine learning techniques in financial analytics and anti-money laundering. The project comprises two distinct case studies, each highlighting the practical utilization of machine learning algorithms for specific financial tasks.

Portfolio ROI and Risk Assessment Using ML

In this case study, we delve into the realm of portfolio management and risk assessment. By leveraging machine learning, I showcase how to quantify the return on investment (ROI) and assess the associated risks of a given portfolio composed of multiple stocks. The project demonstrates the use of ML algorithms to predict the correlation coefficients among the stocks within the portfolio. This enables investors to make more informed decisions by effectively understanding the interdependencies between assets and managing their risk exposure.

Detecting Money Laundering with Classification and Clustering Models

The second case study focuses on combating money laundering using machine learning. This segment illustrates how classification and clustering models can play a pivotal role in identifying suspicious financial activities indicative of money laundering. By training on historical transaction data, the project showcases the creation of models that can flag potentially fraudulent transactions based on patterns that human analysis might overlook. This use of machine learning enhances the efficiency and accuracy of anti-money laundering efforts, contributing to a more secure financial ecosystem.

My project will showcase how you can seamlessly integrate your financial domain knowledge with advanced machine-learning techniques. By doing so, you'll gain the skills to make more informed investment decisions and successfully navigate and overcome intricate real-world financial challenges.
