# ML-FinancialServices
I've developed this Python project, which serves as a comprehensive demonstration of applying machine learning techniques in financial analytics and anti-money laundering. Within this repository, you'll find two distinct case studies, each showcasing the practical utilization of machine learning algorithms for specific financial tasks.
Portfolio ROI and Risk Assessment Using ML

# Portfolio ROI and Risk Assessment Using ML:

In this case study, I delve into the realm of portfolio management and risk assessment. Leveraging machine learning, I demonstrate how to quantify the return on investment (ROI) and evaluate the associated risks of a portfolio composed of multiple stocks. This project highlights the use of ML algorithms to predict correlation coefficients among the stocks within the portfolio, enabling investors to make more informed decisions by understanding the interdependencies between assets and managing their risk exposure.

# Detecting Money Laundering with Classification and Clustering Models:

The second case study centers on combating money laundering using machine learning. This segment illustrates how classification and clustering models can play a pivotal role in identifying suspicious financial activities indicative of money laundering. By training on historical transaction data, I showcase the creation of models capable of flagging potentially fraudulent transactions based on patterns that might elude human analysis. This application of machine learning enhances the efficiency and accuracy of anti-money laundering efforts, thereby contributing to a more secure financial ecosystem.

Throughout my project, I aim to demonstrate how seamlessly integrating financial domain knowledge with advanced machine learning techniques empowers individuals to make informed investment decisions and navigate complex real-world financial challenges.
